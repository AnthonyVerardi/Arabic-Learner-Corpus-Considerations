## About the Project
This project explores the contents of the [Arabic Learner Corpus](https://www.arabiclearnercorpus.com/) (ALC) to assess how they might be applied to Second Language
Acquisition/Teaching. The ALC is a collection of written and spoken texts collected from learners of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in Saudi Arabia, including both
native speaker learners (learning MSA as a prestige variant) and non-native speaker learners. The XML files also accompanied by metadata about each participant and
each observation of their data.
