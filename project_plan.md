# Project Plan

## Overview
In vernacular Arabic, particulary the variety spoken in the Greater Syria/"Levant" region
(Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and partially Iraq), the "active participle" structure
is widely used to convey verbal meaning in the present progressive and habitual present.
Despite its prominence as a structural element of spoken Arabic, there remains little
research on its distribution or even much attention paid to its existence. The aim
of this project is to examine the distribution of active participle lexemes in
spoken Arabic, particularly regarding their distribution. Particular attention
will be paid to whether semantic characteristics of a given root meaning
play a role on when active participles are used to express verbal meanings
as opposed to more standard ideas of a "verb" in Arabic.

Ideally, an annotated corpus of spoken Arabic will be used for the purposes
of this project. Barring that, I plan on exploring ways that I could rely on
the structural characteristics of active participles to code them myself based
on data gathered from publicly-scrapable resources like Twitter and Reddit.
