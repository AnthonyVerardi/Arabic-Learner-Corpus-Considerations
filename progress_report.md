# Progress Report

## Entry 1: Repository Constructed
February 5, 2020

Added:
- `README` file that will contain a brief overview of the project
- `.gitignore` with some basics that should not be screened for upload by GitHub
- `LICENSE` file that will eventually contain a license delineating terms of use
- `project_plan` that contains a general overview of the project, and will be fleshed out in the future
- and of course this `progress_report` file
